Why? I wanted to learn how to make a solid CLI tool in Python. Maybe learn some C++ bindings along the way.
As well as this, I wanted to learn how to make something using machine learning of some type.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/iwishiwasaneagle/z-nlp.git
```

## Making Changes & Contributing

This project uses `pre-commit`, please make sure to install it before making any changes:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
cd z-nlp
pre-commit install
```

It is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```
